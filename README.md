# ActivityForResult_Example
I show how to use the startActivityForResult () methods and onActivityResult () to respectively send and receive data screens 
recently called the current Activity. This is the way to send data and wait for a response Android, do not try hacks using only 
the startActivity () method, 
because the activities of cell may end up bursting.
